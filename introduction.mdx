## Authentication

Any API request needs to have `api_key` in the params.

## Obtaining the Key
To obtain your authentication key, navigate to your [Team Settings](https://app.iomnihub.ai/settings/team-info) in the dashboard. Locate the **API Key** and store it.

## Using the Key
Add `api_key` in the params of your API call. All API requests must be made over HTTPS.
- Calls made over plain HTTP will fail.
- Any request without `api_key` in the params will also fail.

## Key Security
<Warning>Treat your API key like a password. Keep it confidential and never expose it in public repositories, client-side code, or any other public channels.</Warning>

**Key Regeneration:** In the event of a security breach or if you suspect your key has been compromised, regenerate a new key immediately. Contact [Support](mailto:support@iomnihub.ai) for this.

## Authentication Process
Once you have your API key, include it in the HTTP params of your requests under `api_key` as specified in the API documentation. The header should look like this:

```
GET /api/endpoint
Host: api.iomnihub.ai
api_key: YOUR_API_KEY
```

### Example using cURL

```
curl -X GET "https://api.iomnihub.ai/api/endpoint?api_key=<YOUR_API_KEY>"
